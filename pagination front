Update the frontend to support server-side pagination without redesign.

Rules:
- Do NOT change UI layout or styling
- Do NOT change table columns
- Do NOT reload the component on page change
- Do NOT refetch data unless page, pageSize, sort, or filters change

Tasks:
1. Pass page and pageSize to backend API
2. Trigger API call only on paginator events
3. Store current page data in component state
4. Preserve data while navigating within the dashboard
5. Reset to page 1 only when filters or sorting change

Goal:
- Page navigation feels instant
- Table does not reload unnecessarily
- Backend is called only when needed



step2
Fix the SyntaxError by reordering function parameters so that all non-default parameters come before default parameters. Do not rename functions, variables, or endpoints.



step3
Optimize backend performance for email listing without changing:
- function names
- function parameters
- API routes
- response field names
- variable names used by UI

Tasks:
1. Implement fast pagination using ROW_NUMBER() with stable ORDER BY (EMAIL_RECEIVEDTIME DESC, ROW_ID DESC).
2. Add a separate COUNT(*) query to compute total records.
3. Cache total count in memory for 60 seconds.
4. Cache paginated results per page+page_size for 30 seconds.
5. Ensure page navigation does not re-run heavy queries unnecessarily.
6. Do NOT apply pagination logic to stats endpoints.
7. Prevent missing rows, duplicate rows, and inconsistent page sizes.
8. Keep all existing behavior and contracts unchanged.

Goal:
- Page navigation < 1 second
- No UI flicker
- Correct page counts
- Stable data across pages
