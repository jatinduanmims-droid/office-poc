Fix pagination so all pages are available without changing:
- function names
- parameters
- routes
- response field names already used

Problem:
- UI only shows 2 pages instead of ~67
- total_records is incorrect or missing

Tasks:
1. Ensure backend runs a separate COUNT(*) query without pagination.
2. Ensure COUNT query uses the same filters as data query but NO OFFSET / FETCH.
3. Ensure total_records reflects the full dataset size.
4. Include total_records in the response consistently.
5. Ensure paginated data query has stable ORDER BY (EMAIL_RECEIVEDTIME DESC, ROW_ID DESC).
6. Ensure cached counts (if any) refresh correctly.

Do NOT:
- calculate total_records from len(data)
- apply pagination to COUNT query
- change function signatures

Goal:
- UI shows correct number of pages (67+)
- Page navigation works beyond page 2





step2
Fix pagination metadata so paginator shows all pages.

Current problem:
- UI only shows 2 pages even though >600 records exist
- Backend pagination works but total_records is wrong

Tasks:
1. Ensure COUNT(*) query:
   - does NOT use OFFSET / FETCH / LIMIT
   - uses the same WHERE filters as the data query
2. Ensure total_records is returned from SQL COUNT, not len(data)
3. Ensure response always includes:
   - total_records
   - page
   - page_size
4. Ensure ORDER BY is deterministic:
   - EMAIL_RECEIVEDTIME DESC
   - ROW_ID DESC
5. Do not cache paginated results as total count
6. Do not change function names, parameters, or routes

Goal:
- total_records reflects full dataset size
- paginator shows all pages (67+)
- page navigation beyond page 2 works consistently
