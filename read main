I am rebuilding the dashboard UI from scratch but keeping the current backend and APIs.

Provide a backend-focused breakdown for frontend redesign:

1. Dashboard APIs
   - List all endpoints used by the dashboard.
   - For each endpoint provide:
     - URL
     - HTTP method
     - Sample JSON response
     - Response time
     - Whether data is paginated

2. KPI Data Structure
   - What endpoint provides KPI summary?
   - Full sample response JSON.
   - Which fields represent:
     - Events Received Today
     - Requests Received Today
     - Requests Due Today
     - Requests Due in 5 Days
     - Undefined Requests
     - SLA Breaches
   - Are there historical comparison values (yesterday, last week)?

3. Trend Data
   - Endpoint for trend chart.
   - Sample JSON response.
   - Date grouping logic (daily/weekly/monthly).
   - Maximum date range allowed.
   - How missing dates are handled.

4. Controls Summary Table
   - Endpoint used.
   - Sample JSON response.
   - Total row count in production.
   - Is pagination server-side?
   - Is sorting server-side?
   - Is filtering server-side?

5. Available Filters
   - List all supported filters.
   - Field names used.
   - Data types.
   - Default values.
   - Do filters affect KPIs or only table?

6. Role-Based Restrictions
   - Does backend restrict data by user role?
   - Is data scoped by entity/region?
   - Does frontend need to send user context?

7. Performance Constraints
   - Largest table size.
   - Slowest dashboard query.
   - Any caching in place?
   - Any known performance limitations?

Provide structured JSON samples for all responses.
Do not include any UI-related details.
