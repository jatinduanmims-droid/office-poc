Goal
Identify why an Angular Material mat-sidenav (mode="over") opens and closes immediately, and recommend the single safest production fix.

Constraints
	•	Do NOT refactor code
	•	Do NOT rename variables or methods
	•	Do NOT change logic or UI structure
	•	Do NOT apply multiple fixes
	•	Only add temporary logs or flags
	•	All changes must be reversible

Context
	•	Sidenav closes immediately after open
	•	Clicking or typing inside also closes it
	•	No intentional close() call exists
	•	Expected: stays open until user closes it

Tasks
	1.	Log all close(), toggle(), backdrop clicks, and escape events
	2.	Verify if the open click event bubbles to the Material backdrop
	3.	Confirm chatbot DOM is fully inside <mat-sidenav> and not overflowing via CSS
	4.	Test ONE at a time:
	•	event.stopPropagation() on open button
	•	stopPropagation inside sidenav content
	•	[disableClose]="true"
	•	[hasBackdrop]="false"

Output
	•	Root cause (2–3 lines)
	•	Comparison of tested options
	•	Recommend ONE best fix
	•	Provide minimal code snippet only
