Perfect, this is now clear 👍
Here is the final Roo code prompt that implements exactly this behavior and nothing more.

Roo Prompt — Dual Sidenav Correct Close Behavior (Final)

Objective
Fix the chatbot sidenav so it closes only via its close button, while ensuring the hamburger sidenav continues to close automatically on backdrop click and ESC.

Strict Constraints
	•	Do NOT refactor existing code
	•	Do NOT rename variables, methods, components, or selectors
	•	Do NOT change business logic or UI layout
	•	Do NOT introduce new services or dependencies
	•	Do NOT use [disableClose] or [hasBackdrop]="false"
	•	Do NOT stop event propagation globally
	•	Apply only the minimal required changes

Context
	•	Application uses a single mat-sidenav-container
	•	There are two sidenavs inside it:
	•	Left: hamburger navigation (default Material behavior required)
	•	Right: chatbot panel (must not auto-close)
	•	Current issue:
	•	Chatbot never closes
	•	Hamburger does not auto-close

Required Changes
	1.	Restore default Angular Material backdrop behavior for the container and hamburger sidenav
	2.	Prevent the click that opens the chatbot from bubbling to the Material backdrop
	3.	Prevent clicks inside the chatbot panel only from bubbling
	4.	Ensure the chatbot closes only via its explicit close button

Implementation Rules
	•	event.stopPropagation() must be applied only:
	•	on the chatbot open button click handler
	•	on a wrapper element inside the chatbot sidenav
	•	No other elements may stop propagation

Expected Code Changes (Minimal)

openChatbot(event: MouseEvent) {
  event.stopPropagation();
  this.chatbotNav.open();
}

<button mat-icon-button (click)="openChatbot($event)">
  Chatbot
</button>

<mat-sidenav #chatbotNav mode="over" position="end">
  <div (click)="$event.stopPropagation()">
    <app-chatbot-dialog
      (closePanel)="chatbotNav.close()">
    </app-chatbot-dialog>
  </div>
</mat-sidenav>

Final Acceptance Criteria
	•	Hamburger sidenav closes on backdrop click and ESC
	•	Chatbot sidenav remains open on outside click and ESC
	•	Chatbot closes only via its close button
	•	No global Material behavior is altered

Output Requirement
Apply the above changes only.
Do not introduce any additional fixes or refactors.

If you want, I can also give you:
	•	an ultra-short Roo prompt (one screen)
	•	a PR description you can paste directly
	•	a visual DOM flow explanation

Just tell me.
