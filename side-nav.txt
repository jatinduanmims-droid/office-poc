Alright — here’s the final, production-ready Roo prompt.
This one is clean, minimal, and safe. No debugging, no experiments — just the correct fix.

Roo Prompt — Fix Mat-Sidenav Auto-Close (Final)

Objective
Fix the issue where an Angular Material mat-sidenav used for a chatbot opens and immediately closes, without breaking the existing hamburger sidenav behavior.

Strict Constraints
	•	Do NOT refactor existing code
	•	Do NOT rename variables, methods, or components
	•	Do NOT change business logic or UI layout
	•	Do NOT introduce new services or dependencies
	•	Do NOT use [disableClose] or remove the backdrop
	•	Apply only the minimal required change

Context
	•	Application uses Angular Material mat-sidenav with mode="over"
	•	There is a hamburger sidenav that should keep default behavior (close on outside click / ESC)
	•	There is a chatbot sidenav that currently closes immediately after opening
	•	Root cause is click event bubbling to the Material backdrop

Required Fix
	•	Prevent the click event that opens the chatbot sidenav from propagating to the Material backdrop
	•	Preserve default Angular Material behavior for all other sidenavs

Implementation Instructions
	1.	Update the chatbot open handler to receive the click event
	2.	Call event.stopPropagation() before opening the chatbot sidenav
	3.	Do not modify the sidenav configuration or global behavior

Expected Code Change (Minimal)

openChatbot(event: MouseEvent) {
  event.stopPropagation();
  this.chatbotSidenav.open();
}

<button mat-icon-button (click)="openChatbot($event)">
  Chatbot
</button>

Optional Safety Enhancement
	•	Prevent click bubbling inside the chatbot content by stopping propagation on the root container inside the chatbot sidenav

Final Requirement
	•	Hamburger sidenav must continue to close on backdrop click and ESC
	•	Chatbot sidenav must stay open until explicitly closed
	•	No other behavior should change

If you want, I can now give you:
	•	an ultra-short Roo prompt (3–4 lines)
	•	a Jira / PR description for this fix
	•	a layout-level best practice for dual sidenavs

Just say which one.
