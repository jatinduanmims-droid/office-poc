IMPORTANT: Do NOT create any new dashboard folders under src/app or src/app-v2.

TASK:
Relocate (cut + paste, not copy) all EXISTING dashboard-related files into the already-existing folder:

src/app-v2/dashboard

DEFINITION OF "RELOCATE":
- Physically move the same files
- Do NOT duplicate
- Do NOT recreate folders with similar names
- Remove original files after moving

SOURCE LOCATIONS TO SCAN:
- src/app/dashboard/**
- src/app/components/dashboard/**
- src/app/pages/dashboard/**
- src/app-v2/** (if partial dashboard files already exist)

TARGET LOCATION (ONLY THIS):
src/app-v2/dashboard/**

RULES:
1. If a dashboard file already exists in src/app-v2/dashboard, overwrite it.
2. After relocation, NO dashboard-related file should remain outside src/app-v2/dashboard.
3. Do NOT create src/app/dashboard or any new dashboard folder under src/app.
4. Do NOT use standalone components.
5. Update ALL imports to be relative within src/app-v2/dashboard.
6. Ensure dashboard.module.ts declares ALL dashboard components.
7. Ensure dashboard-routing.module.ts routes to DashboardPageComponent.

FINAL CHECK:
- Confirm src/app/dashboard does NOT exist
- Confirm src/app-v2/dashboard contains ALL dashboard files
- Confirm Angular compiles without NG6008 / TS2322 errors
