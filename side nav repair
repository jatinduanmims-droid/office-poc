You are working on an existing Angular + Angular Material dashboard application.

VERY IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT rename, modify, or remove ANY existing function names.
- Do NOT rename, modify, or remove ANY existing variables.
- Do NOT change ANY existing business logic.
- Do NOT refactor existing code structure.
- Do NOT alter routing logic or route definitions.
- Only ADD minimal code where absolutely necessary.

GOAL:
Make the existing left side navigation (mat-sidenav) behave like a hamburger-style sidenav with the following behaviour:

1. The sidenav must always remain CLOSED by default on page load.
2. The sidenav must open ONLY when the user clicks the hamburger (menu) icon in the header.
3. When the user clicks ANY navigation item in the sidenav:
   - The existing navigation logic must execute exactly as it does today.
   - The sidenav must CLOSE immediately after the click.
4. The sidenav must NEVER stay open after navigation.
5. The sidenav state must always reset to CLOSED after any navigation action.

IMPLEMENTATION RULES:
- Reuse the existing `mat-sidenav`, `mat-sidenav-container`, and layout.
- Reuse existing click handlers, routerLinks, and bindings.
- If needed, ONLY ADD:
  - A template reference variable (e.g. `#sidenav`)
  - OR `@ViewChild(MatSidenav)` without changing existing code
- You may ADD `(click)` handlers ONLY to trigger `sidenav.close()` without interfering with current logic.
- Do NOT introduce new state variables or boolean flags.
- Do NOT change existing CSS unless absolutely required.
- Avoid animations or timing logic.

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
- Updated HTML template showing minimal additions only
- Updated TypeScript ONLY if required, with additions clearly isolated
- No renaming, no deletions, no refactors
