You are working in an Angular application.

VERY IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT modify any existing components.
- Do NOT rename any existing routes.
- Do NOT change any existing logic, services, or variables.
- Do NOT refactor or move files.
- ONLY add new routing for an already-created component.

CONTEXT:
A new dashboard page already exists at:
src/app/components/allcontrols.component/dashboardv2/dashboardv2.ts

The component class is:
Dashboardv2Component

GOAL:
Add a new route so this dashboard can be accessed separately,
without impacting the existing dashboard or navigation.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Add a new route path:
   - URL: /dashboardv2
2. Map the route to:
   - Dashboardv2Component
3. Keep all existing routes exactly as they are.
4. Do NOT remove or change any current route.
5. Do NOT introduce lazy loading unless already used.
6. Follow the existing routing style of the project.
7. Import the component using the correct relative path.

OPTIONAL (ONLY IF ALREADY PRESENT IN PROJECT):
- If there is a side navigation menu or header menu:
  - Add a new navigation entry labeled "Dashboard V2"
  - Link it to /dashboardv2
  - Do NOT remove or reorder existing menu items.

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
- Updated routing file with the new route added
- Confirmation that no existing routes or logic were modified
