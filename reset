Analyze the Reset button in dashboard.component.html:

<button mat-button class="custom-save" (click)="resetFilters()">Reset</button>

Debug why clicking this button is not producing the expected behavior.

Steps to follow:
1. Locate the resetFilters() method in the corresponding dashboard.component.ts.
2. Explain exactly what resetFilters() currently does, line by line.
3. Verify whether resetFilters() is being triggered on click (event binding correctness).
4. Check if resetFilters() actually modifies any state used by the table:
   - displayedEmails
   - filters
   - search inputs
   - table data source
5. Verify change detection impact (immutability, reassignment vs mutation).
6. Identify whether PrimeNG p-table requires explicit reset calls (filters, paginator, or table reference).
7. Check for any early returns, async issues, or overwritten state after reset.
8. Explain clearly why the Reset button appears to not work.

Important constraints:
- DO NOT rename any function, variable, or component.
- DO NOT change existing logic.
- DO NOT add new features.
- ONLY analyze, trace, and explain the root cause.
- If logging is required, suggest minimal console logs without modifying behavior.
