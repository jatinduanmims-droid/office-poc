Here’s a short, clean Roo prompt you can paste directly — no fluff, no emojis, enterprise-safe:

Roo Prompt:

Add KPI-driven filtering to the Market Facilities table.
Keep the original dataset unchanged and introduce a filtered dataset bound to the table.
On KPI click:
– “Total Number of Market Facilities” resets the table to all records
– “Market Facilities: Completed” filters rows where status === 'COMPLETE'
– “Market Facilities: Pending” filters rows where status === 'PENDING'

Implement a single reusable applyStatusFilter(status) method in the component .ts.
Wire KPI cards using (click) handlers only.
Do not change existing table structure, column logic, or API calls.
