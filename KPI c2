Here’s a short, clean Roo prompt you can paste directly — no fluff, no emojis, enterprise-safe:

⸻

Roo Prompt:

Add KPI-driven filtering to the Market Facilities table.
Keep the original dataset unchanged and introduce a filtered dataset bound to the table.
On KPI click:
– “Total Number of Market Facilities” resets the table to all records
– “Market Facilities: Completed” filters rows where status === 'COMPLETE'
– “Market Facilities: Pending” filters rows where status === 'PENDING'

Implement a single reusable applyStatusFilter(status) method in the component .ts.
Wire KPI cards using (click) handlers only.
Do not change existing table structure, column 
logic, or API calls.

Here’s a short, precise Roo prompt, aligned with your data reality (blank status = pending):

⸻

Roo Prompt:

Update KPI logic to derive counts directly from the table dataset.

– “Total Number of Market Facilities” should show the total count of all records
– “Market Facilities: Completed” should count records where status === 'COMPLETE'
– “Market Facilities: Pending” should count records where status is blank, null, or undefined

Compute these counts in the component .ts from the existing dataset (no hardcoded values).
Keep existing APIs, table structure, and column logic unchanged.
Ensure KPIs update automatically when the dataset changes.

If you want, I can also give:
	•	an even shorter ultra-minimal version
	•	or a combined prompt (counts + click-to-filter behavior)

Just say which one.
