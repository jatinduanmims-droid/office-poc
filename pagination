Optimize backend performance using server-side pagination and safe lazy loading.

Context:
- Large email dataset causes 20+ second load times
- Full dataset is currently fetched repeatedly
- Previous global caching caused runtime errors

Rules (STRICT):
- Do NOT remove or rename any existing endpoint, function, or variable
- Do NOT change response structure
- Do NOT add global or unsafe caching
- Do NOT preload full datasets

Tasks:
1. Ensure all list endpoints return paginated data ONLY
2. Ensure SQL always uses OFFSET + FETCH (or equivalent)
3. Ensure pageSize is strictly enforced
4. Ensure totalCount is returned via a separate COUNT query
5. Ensure backend is stateless between page requests

Optional (only if safe):
- Add lightweight per-page cache keyed by (page, pageSize, filters)
- Cache must be read-only and fallback-safe

Goal:
- Page 1 loads under 1 second
- Navigation between pages does NOT reload full dataset
- No caching-related crashes

Output:
- Backend-only changes
- Brief explanation of why this improves performance
