Perfect 🔥 this is the right question.

Since you already have the project and Roo Code has access to your codebase + DB models, you need to ask it structured discovery questions so we can redesign this properly.

Below is a ready-to-copy prompt list you can paste into Roo Code one by one.

⸻

🧠 STEP 1 — Understand Data Structure

🔹 Ask This:

List all SQL Server tables used for the C4 Controls Agent dashboard.

For each table, provide:
- Table name
- Column names
- Data types
- Primary key
- Foreign keys
- Indexes

Also mention which tables are directly used for:
- Events
- Requests
- SLA calculations
- Controls summary


⸻

📡 STEP 2 — Understand API Layer

🔹 Ask This:

List all API endpoints used in the dashboard.

For each endpoint provide:
- URL
- HTTP method
- Sample response JSON
- Which SQL query or stored procedure it calls
- Expected response time


⸻

📊 STEP 3 — KPI Logic Discovery

This is VERY important.

🔹 Ask This:

Explain how each dashboard KPI is calculated.

Specifically:
- Events Received Today
- Requests Received Today
- Requests Due in 5 Days
- Requests Due Today
- Undefined Requests
- SLA breaches

Provide:
- Exact SQL query used
- Business rule logic
- Edge cases handled


⸻

📈 STEP 4 — Trend Graph Data

🔹 Ask This:

How is the Events & Requests Trend graph generated?

Provide:
- SQL query
- Grouping logic (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Date range logic
- How missing dates are handled
- Whether aggregation is done in SQL or backend


⸻

📋 STEP 5 — Controls Summary Table

🔹 Ask This:

For the Controls Summary table:

- Which table(s) does it pull from?
- Is pagination server-side or client-side?
- Is filtering server-side or client-side?
- What is the total row count in production?
- Are there performance optimizations (indexes, caching)?


⸻

🎛 STEP 6 — Filters & Business Requirements

🔹 Ask This:

List all available filters in the dashboard.

For each filter:
- Column used
- SQL condition applied
- Is it mandatory?
- Does it affect KPIs or only table?


⸻

👥 STEP 7 — User Roles & Permissions

🔹 Ask This:

Explain role-based access in this dashboard.

- What roles exist?
- What data restrictions apply?
- Are controls filtered by user?
- Is data scoped by entity or region?


⸻

⚡ STEP 8 — Performance Constraints

🔹 Ask This:

Provide:
- Average daily record count
- Total records in main tables
- Query execution times
- Any known performance bottlenecks
- Whether caching exists


⸻

🎨 STEP 9 — UI Structure Audit

This is key for redesign.

🔹 Ask This:

Analyze current Angular dashboard structure:

- Component hierarchy
- Services used
- State management approach
- Chart library used
- CSS framework used
- Responsiveness approach
- Known UI issues


⸻

🏗 WHY This Matters

Once you give me answers from Roo Code, I can:

✅ Redesign layout properly
✅ Suggest better graph types
✅ Reduce visual clutter
✅ Improve KPI placement
✅ Suggest SQL aggregation improvements
✅ Improve performance
✅ Create modular Angular structure
✅ Give you production-grade UI layout

⸻

🧩 Bonus — One Master Prompt (If You Want All At Once)

If you want to ask Roo everything in one go:

Provide a complete technical breakdown of the C4 Controls Agent dashboard including:

1. SQL tables and schema
2. API endpoints and response format
3. KPI calculation logic
4. Trend chart aggregation logic
5. Controls summary query
6. Filtering logic
7. Role-based data restrictions
8. Performance constraints
9. Angular component structure
10. Current UI/UX limitations

Provide structured response with SQL queries and JSON samples.
